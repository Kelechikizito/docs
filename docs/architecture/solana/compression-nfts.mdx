# Compression NFTs

Helium joined the Solana network by minting each hotspot as an NFT â€” a process made possible by the recent release of state compression. Minting a compressed NFT costs fractions of a penny on the dollar compared to an uncompressed token. The NFTs act as credentials, verify authenticity, and provide data for developers. They also enable token-gated experiences.

# Compression NFTs update

Seven months after the announcement of compressed NFTs, the Solana Foundation has conclusive data on the actual cost of using compression. 
As of Dec. 20, 2023,Helium can use cNFTs to mint one million NFTs for $247.80 (compared to the initial estimates of $113.42 in April 2023)
